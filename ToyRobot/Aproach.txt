This was how I approached the exercise: 

1 - create the interfaces
2 - initiate the robot 
3 - implement the movement with restrictions (so it doesn't fall from the table)
4 - implement MOVE, PLACE, RIGHT and LEFT.
5 - Implement REPORT
6 - implement a message when the robot would fall and the command is dropped
7 - Test the conditions to ensure it is working fine

Further development:

 1 - Improve UI
 2 - Implement unit tests for all methods
